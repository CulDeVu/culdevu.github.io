		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			[[No image, sorry :( ]]
		</p>
		<p>
			My name if Daniel Taylor, but I go by Danny usually. Although, if you call me by my nickname, I might think you're someone from highschool or something.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm into offline and realtime graphics, as well as indie gamedev, mathematics, and CS in general. Most of the stuff I do are just little projects, unfortunately, and aren't on the Projects page.
		<p>
			I'm not very involved on the web, but I lurk around on a bunch of places. You can find me at:<br><br>
			<a href="http://www.gamedev.net/user/175326-culdevu/">GameDev.net</a> (except don't actually look at my older posts. It just shows how dumb I used to be)<br>
