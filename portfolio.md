I have tinkered with a lot of different things in a lot of different areas, from computer graphics, to game programming, to CUDA programming blah blah blah

Video Game prototypes
===

I've made quite a few little video game tech demos showing a video game mechanic I had been toying with. Each one of them are themed completely around a mechanic that I thought would be "fun" to play an actual video game with. All of the art is hand-done by me, which is why there's not much of it. Each of these were made over the course of 2 or 3 months, and are, at the moment, at varying levels of polish and stability.

Crystal is a game where you attach gravity wells to various objects in the world. In this game, you manipulate gravity to solve puzzles and to navigate the world.

You can then use the gravity wells to scale walls, to reach otherwise impossible places, to walk on the undersides of platforms, and loads of other cool tricks. You can use your powers creating and canceling gravity to fling yourself (and enemies, and other objects) around level, to manipulate swinging platforms, to solve puzzles, the whole nine platforming yards!

This game demo was (largely) made for and shown at a tech expo that is hosted annually at high-school during my senior year there. This game demo is, at the time of writing, the largest and most elaborate project that any student has ever submitted and displayed.

Things I learned and barriers that I had to overcome:

- Learned how to interface with LWJGL and OpenAL, and Box2D
- Learned practical methods to overcome Java's garbage collector to maintain a relatively constant framerate
- Built a graphics module designed for rapid prototyping but that was also clean and fast
