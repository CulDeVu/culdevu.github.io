      <description>So. Back at this.
First things first. You can safely disregard most everything I said last post. All of that was very observation-based, and is actually incorrect in almost every way. Which might seem strange, cause most of it made sense. For clarity and completeness, though, here&#39;s a list of why everything last post was wrong:
 The idea that a fold is a collection of fold segments in order starts falling apart after you do certain folds, like petal folds.</description>

      <title>Origami and the Associated Maths</title>

      <description>So this is going to be another one of those write-it-out-so-that-I-can-better-understand-it sort of things. Just a heads up. This IS a journal, after all, and functions as advertisement second.
So. Origami and mathematics. We know that the two are related because, if you fold a piece of paper the same way twice, you&amp;rsquo;ll get two of the same shape, so there&amp;rsquo;s rules governing it. And some smart people have tried figuring out those rules.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not really going to talk about much math-y stuff this time. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered too much ground since my last entry to be able to remember all the pitfalls I ran into. So this time I&amp;rsquo;m only really going to be talking about the general algorithm, how I deal with the pitfalls of the marker particle method, and the ongoing translation to CUDA. And probably share some of my Mario Maker levels.</description>

      <title>Factored BRDF Representation</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on life/jobs/family/etc the past couple months. A couple weeks ago, however, I decided to implement a type of arbitrary BRDF sampling based on factoring large matrices, found here: http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/brdf/brdf.pdf
The idea is to convert the BRDF into a series of matrix representations in such a way that
\[ f_r(\omega_i, \omega_o)(wi \cdot \textbf{n}) \approx \sum{l=1}^{L}{ F_l(\omega_o) u_l(\theta_h) v_l(\phi_h) } \]
, where \( F_l \), \( u_l \), and \( vl \) are massive matrices that depend on outgoing direction, half angle azimuth, and half angle zenith about surface normal, respectively.</description>

      <description>Not many images or videos this time around, unfortunately. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly about updates about what I&amp;rsquo;m up to and what I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
So, first off, the non-euclidean stretchy game thingy. Turns out that some people in my art class had taken an interest in it when I was working on it in class, and they offered to help offload some of the content generation, like making art, animations, level design, etc.</description>

      <title>HBR: Human Based Rendering</title>

      <description>Heyy all!
So the graphics professor at school here was talking to me and he was like &amp;ldquo;you know what would be a cool idea?&amp;rdquo; Turns out, it WAS a cool idea.
So! I present to you:
HBR: Human Based Rendering (the photon mapping of the next generation) The general idea is to either get the user that&amp;rsquo;s looking at a screen to plot the photons themselves, or somehow crowd-source rendering an environment by manually tracing out light paths.</description>
