		<p>
			It's true! My very first blog post EVER!
		</p>
		<p>
			I know you didn't think people like that were still around. I think I'm the last.

			But yeah! The site's under developement, but feel free to check in again soon.

			I'm going to be starting a tutorial on global illumination. This is mostly because, when I was learning, there was really no information out there about the gritty specifics of how to do things. There were high-level tutorials, and there were heavy math-based tutorials, and there was a random forum post or twelve that pushed me in the right direction. And, while that search and struggle for information was extremely helpful, I kinda wish that a better tutorial was out there.

			So! Here goes nothing!
