			Crystal is an indie game (in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2emzst/i_think_we_need_a_new_category_of_games_called/">truest sense!</a>) where you manipulate gravity to solve puzzles and to navigate the world.

			In Crystal you play as a little robot with the ability to attach gravity wells to objects in the game world. You can then use the gravtity wells to scale walls, to reach otherwise impossible places, to walk on the undersides of platforms, and loads of other cool tricks. You can use your powers creating and cancelling gravity to fling yourself (and enemies, and other objects) around level, to manipulate swinging platforms, to solve puzzles, the whole nine platforming yards!

			Unfortunately, though, it's hard to make a game this dynamic. I've worked on it for about 9 or 10 months now, and I'm not even in alpha yet. Level design for this game was unusually difficult, and the game took a lot out of me. If anyone actually shows intrest in this game, let me know. But until then, I'm going to put this one off until I can find more time to devote to it.
