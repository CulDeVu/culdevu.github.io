        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Daniel Taylor. My pastimes include trying to sample as many 
            interesting programming projects I can get my hands on, specifically 
            in the field of Computer Graphics. I'm currently a student at George 
            Mason University, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
        </p>

    If you are looking to hire, all you have to do is show a passing interest! 
    My <a href="{{ site.url }}/portfolio/">portfolio</a> and 
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume/">resume</a> are available, but I'd love 
    to make a more customized one for your company!

    or maybe have one of those "sort posts by catagory" things that are all the rage
