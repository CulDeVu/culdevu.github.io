            <p>So this is going to be another one of those write-it-out-so-that-I-can-better-understand-it sort of things. Just a heads up. This IS a journal, after all, and functions as advertisement second.</p> <p>So. Origami and mathematics. We know that the two are related because, if you fold a piece of paper the same way twice, you’ll get two of the same shape, so there’s rules governing it. And some smart people have tried figuring out those rules. There’s a bunch of them, but they all fall short for what I’m wanting to do. So here it goes:</p> <p>Together with research in 1992, and...

            <p>I’m not really going to talk about much math-y stuff this time. I’ve covered too much ground since my last entry ( Posted Image ) to be able to remember all the pitfalls I ran into. So this time I’m only really going to be talking about the general algorithm, how I deal with the pitfalls of the marker particle method, and the ongoing translation to CUDA. And probably share some of my Mario Maker levels. I’m addicted to stars Posted Image</p> <p>So! Let’s do this!</p> <p>[media]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xBAqjxHUkA[/media]</p> <p>Sorry for the video being kinda shaky. OBS is having a hard time...

            <p>It’s been quite a while.</p> <p>So I’ve been working on life/jobs/family/etc the past couple months. A couple weeks ago, however, I decided to implement a type of arbitrary BRDF sampling based on factoring large matrices, found here: http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/brdf/brdf.pdf</p> <p>The idea is to convert the BRDF into a series of matrix representations in such a way that</p> <p>[attachment=28227:CodeCogsEqn (1).gif]</p> <p>, where Fl, ul, and vl are matrices that depend on outgoing direction, half angle azimuth, and half angle zenith about surface normal, respectively. Now that the functions for half angle azimuth and zenith are separated out, it’s trivial to construct a...

            <p>Not many images or videos this time around, unfortunately. It’s mostly about updates about what I’m up to and what I’m working on.</p> <p>So, first off, the non-euclidean stretchy game thingy. Turns out that some people in my art class had taken an interest in it when I was working on it in class, and they offered to help offload some of the content generation, like making art, animations, level design, etc. This is actually exactly what I need in order to continue working on it, so you’ll be seeing some gosh-darn pretty images in the future, after finals are...
