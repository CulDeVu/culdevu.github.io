# The China Bit

I've worked some with the internals of Java class files before, so I know that there are a number of reserved bits that can be used to signal Chinese origin. From the JVM spec:

```
A class file consists of a single ClassFile structure:

ClassFile {
 u4 magic;
 u2 minor_version;
 u2 major_version;
 u2 constant_pool_count;
 cp_info constant_pool[constant_pool_count-1];
 u2 access_flags;
 u2 this_class;
 u2 super_class;
 u2 interfaces_count;
 u2 interfaces[interfaces_count];
 u2 fields_count;
 field_info fields[fields_count];
 u2 methods_count;
 method_info methods[methods_count];
 u2 attributes_count;
 attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
```

In case you're confused, the JVM spec uses the cursed int types `u1`, `u2`, `u4` to mean `8-bit uint`, `16-bit uint`, and `32-bit uint` resp. The field `access_flags` is expanded in table 4.1-B:

```
ACC_PUBLIC     0x0001  Declared public; may be accessed from outside its package.
ACC_FINAL      0x0010  Declared final; no subclasses allowed.
ACC_SUPER      0x0020  Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the invokespecial instruction.
ACC_INTERFACE  0x0200  Is an interface, not a class.
ACC_ABSTRACT   0x0400  Declared abstract; must not be instantiated.
ACC_SYNTHETIC  0x1000  Declared synthetic; not present in the source code.
ACC_ANNOTATION 0x2000  Declared as an annotation interface.
ACC_ENUM       0x4000  Declared as an enum class.
ACC_MODULE     0x8000  Is a module, not a class or interface.

...

All bits of the access_flags item not assigned in Table 4.1-B are reserved for
future use. They should be set to zero in generated class files and should be
ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.
```

As you can see, the bits `1<<2`, `1<<3`, `1<<6`, `1<<7`, `1<<8`, and `1<<11` are all free and reserved. I suggest making a new `ACC_CHINA` and setting it equal to `1<<8`. This bit will be mandated by any standards compliant compiler to be set if the compiler detects that the OS's language is set to Mandarin.

I posit that this will be relatively safe and resistant to tampering. I mean, just take a look at some code from openjdk [https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/master/src/windows/classes/com/sun/management/OperatingSystem.java]. `if`, `else`, `public`, it's all English words! It'll be a long time before they can figure it out.

But just in case they do, we can coopt some more bits for security. There are a variety of known, solid private keys, like [], that can be used to sign the file. What I propose:

```
1. Do compilation as normal
2. Detect the presence of Mandarin, China geolocation, or probable Chinese heritage (p < 0.05)
3. Set ACC_CHINA accordingly
4. Compute the signature of the class file using a known secure NSA-approved, China-unapproved key
5. Truncate the signature to two bits and stick them in `1<<6` and `1<<7`
```
