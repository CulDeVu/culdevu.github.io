		<div style="background: #fafafa; padding: 20px"><h2 style="margin-bottom:0.5rem">A self-exploration of image compression</h2><i>Pub. 2023 Jan 8</i><p>This is an experiment in a different format. This is me documenting my trial-and-error process of learning about image compression. I'm calling this a self-exploration because I'm not going to do any research at all, it's all going to be guided by my own observations and ideas. All I'm starting off with is an understanding of entropy and arithmetic encoding.</p><p>I've written a PNG decoder and a zip DEFLATE decoder on two separate occasions, one of which was used for the PNG decoding. This is to say that I know basically nothing about image compression. </p><p>Starting out, I'm mostly interested in byte-based compression, not bit-based. I'm also only going to be working with the luminance channel for now. Each image is 1024x1024, so we're looking at 8388608 bits with no compression. I'm mostly interested in compression and transformations that can be done in parallel via SIMD or GPGPUs easily, and computations that can be done using <code class="codeinline">u8</code> arithmetic, or arithmetic on Z/256Z. I'm also mostly interested in lossless compression.</p><p>Here are the 3 images I'm going to be using. I chose to use images I screencap'd from Shadertoy because they're visually interesting 3d scenes that I can be absolutely sure have no lossy compression artifacts already.</p><p><table><tr style="vertical-align:top"><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="iq.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>iq.png</figcaption></figure></td><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="squiggles.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>squiggles.png</figcaption></figure></td><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="xp_pipes.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>xp_pipes.png</figcaption></figure></td></tr></table></p><p>For those in the back who have trouble hearing me, I'll speak up.</p><p>YES, I KNOW. A SAMPLE SET OF 3 IMAGES ISN'T REPRESENTATIVE OF IMAGE COMPRESSION AS A WHOLE. THIS IS A VERY SMALL TEST OF VERY SIMPLE TECHNIQUES, AND AN EXCERCISE IS STRENGTHENING MY INTUITION ABOUT COMPRESSION. NOTHING MORE. </p><p>Finding the histogram and the entropy of the pixels in the images gives:</p><ul><li>base entropy iq: 8069412</li><li>base entropy squiggles: 7841410</li><li>base entropy xp_pipes: 7618695</li></ul><p>Which means that, if I was to just concat the pixel histogram with the arithmetically coded pixel values (assuming that the histogram could be represented in 8 bits per bin without loss of efficiency) we'd get 8071460, 7843458, 7620743 resp, achieving 0.96, 0.93, 0.91 percent file sizes with just that step. Zip files will sometimes contain embedded (themselves compressed) huffman tables, so this isn't that weird.</p><p>Here are the histograms:</p><p><table><tr style="vertical-align:top"><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="iq_base_histogram.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>base histogram iq</figcaption></figure></td><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="squiggles_base_histogram.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>base histogram squiggles</figcaption></figure></td><td width=33.333%><figure><img src="xp_pipes_base_histogram.png" style="width:100%"><figcaption>base histogram xp_pipes</figcaption></figure></td></tr></table></p><p>Now the basis of all of the image and video compression techniques I know about is that pixels nearby are more similar than pixels far away. I wonder how true that is? Let's graph pairs of adjacent pixels.</p><pre class="codeblock"><code>// pairs entropy

Doing the same as last time, encoding pairs of bytes and storing them along with the pairs-of-bytes-histogram, isn't <i>that</i> bad as of yet, it's still a win.

For quads of pixels, the histogram would be 4GB. We'll get back to that later.</p><p>But we're not there yet.

</code></pre><p>This code, from the bottom up, computes for each pixel the difference between it and the pixel immediately above it. For the top line it computes differences between each pixel and the one to its left. This is a brain-dead simple to decompress in SIMD, so that's a big win in my book.</p><ul><li>running difference iq: 4108178</li><li>running difference squiggles: 5722964</li><li>running difference xp_pipes: 5352603</li></ul><p>Great! File sizes are nearly half the raw uncompressed size for iq.png, and around 70% for the other two. For reference, these single-channel pngs are sized 3652640, 5197448, 5140888 bits resp. So this very simple encoding is within 5% of PNG's size, measured against the raw entropy compression of the image bytes, or about 10% measured against the PNG sizes. This isn't representative by any measure, but it is interesting.</p><p>No doubt this can be fiddled with, adding bits here or there to pick a better pixel to compare against. But as it stands this compressor is only taking into account one neighbor for each pixel, not a representation of what all of the other pixels around them look like as a whole. So for instance, saying "this block of 16x16 pixels are all smoothly transitioning colors from here to here" will probably be better than "encode a value of -1 for each pixel in this 16x16 block". This is probably a good direction to go in, I'd imagine. I mean, macroblock coding has to be popular for a good reason, right?</p><p>I want to go back to the pixel pairs for a second. Let's do the transformation <code class="codeinline">data[i+0], data[i+1] -> data[i+0], (data[i+1] - data[i+0])</code>. Taking the entropy of these pairs gives 5903458, 6643549, 6353101. This is exactly the entropy for the pairs untransformed, which is a good sanity check since that transformation is reversible. But just for shits and giggles, what would happen if I were to entropy encode every other byte separately?</p><pre class="codeblock"><code>// pairs separated

I expected the result to be far closer to the original base entropy result. But, thinking about it a little, it makes some sense. Say I'm taking an input of <code class="codeinline">1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2</code> and turning it into <code class="codeinline">1 0 2 0 1 0 2 0</code>. The entropy of adjacent pairs doesn't change because there's just as many <code class="codeinline">1 1</code>s in the first as there are <code class="codeinline">1 0</code>s in the second, etc. But the entropy of the pairs separated is less than the base entropy because we're going from an entropy of <code class="codeinline">4*0.5*log(0.5) + 4*0.5*log(0.5) = 8</code> to <code class="codeinline">(2*0.5*log(0.5) + 2*0.5*log(0.5)) + 4*1*log(1) = 4</code>.</p><p>In addition to the entropy win, there's also a win in the amount of histogram bits that will have to go in the file too. As said previously, at 8 bits per bucket of the pixel pairs histogram (at the moment I'm only thinking about storing the histograms uncompressed), we're looking at 64KB. With this method we're looking at a histogram size of 512B.</p><p>But the win I'm most interested in is the following: we have a very cheap and expandable method of generating distributions that have decent entropy, and a <i>lower bound</i> on the best entropy that this method is able to achieve. Because this pair separation method will never be able to get a lower entropy than the entropy of the pairs themselves, right? So I can know how far away I am from optimal, for an admittedly silly definition of optimal.</p><p>Here for the iq image, I'm 110927 bit away, about 13KB or around two tenths of a bit per pixel. So what else is to be done?</p><p>The classic transformation, <code class="codeinline">diff[i+0], diff[i+1] -> (diff[i+0] + diff[i+1])/2, (diff[i+0] - diff[i+1])/2</code> isn't reversible.

All three were within 8% of their respective PNG sizes, measured relative the PNG size. In fact, quad running difference squiggles was a mere 800 bytes away! Another interesting thing to note is that for xp_pipes, the transform <code class="codeinline">[ 0 0 1 -1 ]</code> was actually slightly better by about 600 bytes.</p><p>But there's one more thing I'd like to try. In a running difference situation, by the time you get to a pixel for decoding, you've already decoded the pixel to the top and to the left. So unlike all the stuff that was happening above, where I was trying to transform pixels in a way that preserves enough info to recover all of the inputs, I can go wild. Any transformation of the form <code class="codeinline">crazy_function(top, left) - curr</code> is fair game.</p><p>Specifically I was thinking about the transformation <code class="codeinline">(top + left)/2 - curr</code>. I'm hoping that it'll be a big win, since</p><p>$$\begin{align}Var\left(\frac{top + left}{2} - curr\right) = & \, Var\left(\frac{(top - curr) + (left - curr)}{2}\right) \\= & \frac{1}{4} Var\left((top - curr) + (left - curr)\right) \\\approx & \frac{1}{2} Var(left - curr)\end{align}$$</p><p>Of course variance isn't the same as entropy, and divisions by two are lossy, but hopefully it's enough justification for this method being much better than the first running difference we did!</p><pre class="codeblock"><code>int histo[256] = {0};

A 3x3 pixel block (I think) would have the possibility of doing divisions by two more easily inside of the maps. The pixel quad transformations that I was doing are all trivial to SIMD-ify.

I guess I feel like it should be way way better than that already. So like 3 bits gets you only 8 possible values. But get this, I measured how much of the pairs entropy came from pairs that are within 4 values (7 possible differences) of each other, and it was 4637169 (out of 5903458 in iq.png, or about 78%). But the number of pixels that that counts is 441742, which brings us to the conclusion that among those small differences the average bits per pixel is 10.5! I guess I didn't expect the empty parts of the main diagonal to be so costly.</p></div><div style="background-color: #222; padding: 1em; color: #fafafa">Written by Daniel Taylor.<br>Email: contact@djtaylor.me<br><br><span style="color: #aaa">© 2024 by Daniel Taylor</span></div><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
