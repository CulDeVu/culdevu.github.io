== √Flatland³
=== wip

This is my pitch for a new flatland movie [-], based very loosely on the book link(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphereland)[Sphereland: A Fantasy About Curved Spaces and an Expanding Universe] [-], called √Flatland³ [-].

[TODO]

$$
\begin{aligned}
C & = 2 \pi L - C_1 L^3 + C_2 L^5 \\
  & = 2 \pi (L - D_1 \frac{L^3}{3!} + D_2 \frac{L^5}{5!}) \\
  & = 2 \pi (D^0 L - D^2 \frac{L^3}{3!} + D^4 \frac{L^5}{5!}) \\
  & = 2 \pi (\frac{1}{D} \phi - \frac{1}{D} \frac{\phi^3}{3!} + \frac{1}{D} \frac{\phi^5}{5!}) \\
  & \approx 2 \pi \frac{1}{D} \sin{\phi}
\end{aligned}

[-] 

[-] There is a link(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland_%282007_Johnson_and_Travis_film%29#Sequel)[2012 short movie adaptation] of this book already, by the same guys who did the link(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland_%282007_Johnson_and_Travis_film%29)[2007 Flatland short movie].

[-] The 2012 adaptation is titled "Flatland²" in the movie's titlecard, even though people seem to call it "Flatland 2". I dislike this name. If the implication is that Flatland=2 (because flatland, the world, is 2D), then Flatland²=4, and I don't know what 4 would be referring to. While 4th dimension does come up, it's not the main focus of the movie. If Flatland=1 (because Flatland is the first movie in the series), then Flatland²=1 which doesn't make sense. What, are we suppose to assume that Flatland = $\sqrt{2}$?

I think my title, √Flatland³, more thematically consistant. [TODO]
