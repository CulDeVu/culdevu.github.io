== Astronomical algorithm test vectors
=== Just some numbers.

I recently learned a bit about astronomical algorithms from reading Jean Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms 2nd edition.

When I was starting, I wanted more test vectors. I also wouldn't have minded test vectors that added some intuition. Hopefully these help.

In the following, "latitude/longitude" refers to the traditional ecliptic coordinates, whereas "lat/lon" refers to more normal coordinates, with lon 0 being the prime meridian. All measurements are done using the mean equator, not the true equator. So nutation is not taken into account.
