== Aliasing
=== wip

This is my kneejerk reaction to aliasing:

This is probably a little overkill. For example, here are two sinousoids, $\sin(2 \pi 0.49 t)$ and $\sin(2 \pi 0.51 t)$, sampled at 1Hz with no filtering (constant frequency response), sinc-reconstructed. Can *you* tell the difference?

[graphs]

I can't.

That being said, when I do any sort of computer graphics thing, I usually do default to box filters. It's just real easy to jitter rays in a square, or to render at 4x resolution and then downsample 4x, for example.

I *know* intellectually that box filters alias, but I don't think I've ever really *seen* it. So let's do that.

# Miore

The big effect of aliasing is Miore patterns, so let's see that.

Here is a signal $128 + 128 \sin(2 \pi \frac{7}{8} t)$, box filtered, sampled at integer coordinates, and then reconstructed.

# Flickering

The other big effect of aliasing is flickering.

The red curve is $\cos(2 \pi \frac{7}{8} (t - \lambda)) + \cos(2 \pi \frac{1}{8} (t - \lambda))$.

The red signal is box filtered to make the green signal: $\cos(2 \pi \frac{7}{8} (t - \lambda)) \text{sinc}(\frac{7}{8}) + \cos(2 \pi \frac{1}{8} (t - \lambda)) \text{sinc}(\frac{1}{8})$.

The green signal is sampled at the integers and reconstructed to make the blue signal: $\cos(2 \pi (\frac{7}{8} t + \frac{1}{8} \lambda)) \text{sinc}(\frac{7}{8}) + \cos(2 \pi \frac{1}{8} (t - \lambda)) \text{sinc}(\frac{1}{8})$.
