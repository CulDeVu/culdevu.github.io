      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on life/jobs/family/etc the past couple months. A couple weeks ago, however, I decided to implement a type of arbitrary BRDF sampling based on factoring large matrices, found here: http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/brdf/brdf.pdf
The idea is to convert the BRDF into a series of matrix representations in such a way that
\[ f_r(\omega_i, \omega_o)(wi \cdot \textbf{n}) \approx \sum{l=1}^{L}{ F_l(\omega_o) u_l(\theta_h) v_l(\phi_h) } \]
, where \( F_l \), \( u_l \), and \( vl \) are massive matrices that depend on outgoing direction, half angle azimuth, and half angle zenith about surface normal, respectively.</description>

      <description>Heyy all!
So the graphics professor at school here was talking to me and he was like &amp;ldquo;you know what would be a cool idea?&amp;rdquo; Turns out, it WAS a cool idea.
So! I present to you:
HBR: Human Based Rendering (the photon mapping of the next generation) The general idea is to either get the user that&amp;rsquo;s looking at a screen to plot the photons themselves, or somehow crowd-source rendering an environment by manually tracing out light paths.</description>
