		<h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
		<p>
			It's true! My very first blog post EVER!
		</p>
		<p>
			I know you didn't think people like that were still around. I think I'm the last.
		</p>
		<p>
			But yeah! The site's under developement, but feel free to check in again soon.

			I'm going to be starting a tutorial on global illumination. This is mostly because, when I was learning, there was really no information out there about the gritty specifics of how to do things. There were high-level tutorials, and there were heavy math-based tutorials, and there was a random forum post or twelve that pushed me in the right direction. And, while that search and struggle for information was extremely helpful, I kinda wish that a better tutorial was out there. Since then, the excelent tutorial by "The Phantom" Jacco Bikker <a href="http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Raytracing_Topics_Techniques-Part_1_Introduction.shtml">found here</a> and the guides by Zach Waters have been made, but <i>really?</i> <i>Two</i> tutorials on the internet for such an interesting topic? <i>Really?</i>

			So! Here goes nothing!
